# Arduino-Ball-Launcher-with-Velocity-Measurement-and-LCD-Display
This Arduino project launches a ball using a servo, detects it with an ultrasonic sensor, and calculates velocity based on time of flight. A potentiometer sets the angle, and an LCD shows the angle, time, and velocity. Ideal for physics demos and basic motion experiments.
